ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANJLJUS 227

palpable. Manilius occupies himself mainly with the signs of
the Zodiac and the fixed stars; Firmicus’ Allallzesz's treats of
Astrology as drawn from the planets. Exactly the same line
was followed by the author of the work known as Illanellzom's
Apotelesmatica, a Greek poem, mainly in hexameters‚ which in
the 18th century Ludwig Ziegler assigned to the age between
Augustus and Constantine, but which in modern times has been
pronounced by Arminius Kochly to be made up of two distinct
poems, one written in the age of Alexander Severus, the other
by a contemporary of Julian.

From Firmicus to the xth century Manilius falls out of sight.
No passage has yet been found written during that interval
which refers to his poem. But though in the xvith and xviith
centuries‚ when astrology was in fashion and poems on as-
trology read, there was, especially among the Jesuits‚ some stndy
of the literature of the Middle Age, it is only within the last
half century that anything like a comprehensive examination of
this literature has been attempted: and during that time
Manilius has almost wholly ceased to attract the attention of
scholars. It is therefore not impossible that lines or adaptations
of the Aslronomz'ca may have escaped notice3 just as, in the
parallel case of the Ibis, no one before myself had observed that
one whole verse has been transferred almost unaltered to the
Commonitorium of the Christian poet Orientius1.

Manilius reemerges in the earliest and best MS of his poem
at the end of the xth or early in the xith century ². This is the
codex Gen1blacens22v‚ so named from the Belgian village Gembloux,
a monastery in which was long the possessor of this unique
treasure. Another copy, written according to Bechert, about 50
years later, is now at Leipsic. The Cusanus, which Ι have myself
partially collated, is assigned by Oehler to the xiith century.

These MSS though closely agreeing have yet so many points

¹ Ib. 1 17 Sisque miser uere nec sis miserabilis ulli. Orient. Common. ii.
315 Ille miser uere nec erit miserabilis ulli. The articles of Dr. Manitius
show what important results learning combined with industry and mernory
may still effect in this department.
