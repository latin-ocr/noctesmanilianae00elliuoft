This codex (M 31) forms the first portion of a complete MS
the second half of which (X 81) contains f. 1-17 a chronicle‚

Both Lowe and Beer agree in considering these two MSS
to be different parts of one whole. We have therefore here,
in a single codex, the four works rediscovered by Poggio‚ as
stated in the subscriptio of the Florentine MS of Asconius cited
above. Lowe farther states that the Asconius and Valerius
Flaccus, which are not in the same handwriting as the Manilius
and Statius, may have been written by Poggio, to whom he
seems also to ascribe the corrections on the first page of the
Statius.

It is observable that all these witnesses speak of Manilius as
re-dz'scoz’ered by Poggio. It is clear that they did not know
of the existence of any other MSS, the Gemblacensis‚ Lipsiensis,
or Cusanus. It may be inferred therefore with more than pro-
bability that no copy of the Astronomica was then known to
be extant in Italy. We may perhaps conclude that Poggio’s
transcript of the S. Gallen MS was the parent of all the xvth
century Italian codices.

What then is the name of the poet in perhaps the earliest
of these copies, that in the National Library of Madrid?
He is called at the commencement of B. Ι M. Manilius, at
the end of B. ΙΙ Μ. Manilius Boetius. This is practically
