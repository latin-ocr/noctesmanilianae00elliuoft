ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANJLIUS 219

second collation is extant in the royal library of Berlin, gives
this extra name as Poeni (Bentl. Praef. p. xi, Bechert de emend.
Manil. p. 15). .

The other xvth century MSS agree in giving the name as
M. Mallius, Manlius, or Manilius. Thus in the MS in the
library of Corpus Christi at Oxford (ο) the poet is always
Manilius: in the Bodleian codex (b) always Manlius.

Whence did this name corne into the MSS? Was it in-
troduced in the xvth century, or transmitted from the Middle
Age?

Bentley thought it was introduced in the xvth century, by
some scholar who identified the Manlius Antiochus astrologiae
conditor of Plin. H. N. xxxv. 199 with the author of our
astrologica] poem in five books. F reier, taking the heading of
the Vossianus secundus as typical of the whole collection of
xvth century tituli, points to the accumulation of names by which
Augustus is addressed in it, Dz'uo Oct. Quirino Angusto, as a
mark of lateness‚ and ascribes it to some contemporary of the
astrological writer Firmicus ¹. Combining Man. Ι. 7 Hunc mz'lzz‘
tu Caesar patriae princepsque paterque chz‘regz's augustis parentem
legibus orbem with 800, 801 Quod regit Angustus socio per szgrna
Tonante Cernit et 2'n coetu Diuum magnumque Quz'rinnm, he may
have constructed out of these lines the unskilful whole Diuo Oct.
Quirino Augusto, an inept accumulation of titles which un-
mistakably betrays the Byzantine epoch of its composition.
Thus made up, the heading passed, Freier thinks, from one
copy of the poem to another, long before the period at which it
is mentioned by Gerbert, towards the end of the xth century.

A third view is that the words of Gerbert M. Manlms de
Astrologz'a, are the only foundation sor the name in the xvth
century MSS.

Ι shall try to show—

(1) That no theory which regards the name as an introduc-
tion of the xvth century is likely.
