ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANILIUS.

ΝοΝΕ of the earliest MSS contain the name of Manilius. In
the Gembloux codex (xth or xith century) ¹, the original heading
of the poem, which filled two lines, is erased, and a later hand,
seemingly of the xvith century, has substituted Malius poeta.
The divisions, however, of the five books are marked and explicitly
stated at the end of each.

In the Cusanus also, which like the Gemblacensis is now in
the Royal Library of Brussels, the heading or [dulus of B. I is
thus given in capitals,

ARATI PHILOSOPHI ASTRONOMICON LIBER
PRIMVS INCIPIT PRELIBATIO.

Exactly the same heading is given in the Lipsiensis ², which
Bechert states (p. 10) to be about 50 years later than the
Gemblacensis. Iacob thought (Praef. to his Manilius p. vii)
that the original heading in the Lipsiensis was different, as the
first three words were written over an erasure. Bechert, how-
ever, who had excellent opportunities of examining the MS,
states that under the word ASTRONOMICON the traces of
the same word are still faintly perceptible.

This is also the superscription of the Vossianus primus, which,
however, was written in the xvth century.

The attribution of the poem to Aratus is either a conjecture
or a misapplication. Some one who knew of the existence of
