228 ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANJLIL'S

of variance as to make it improbable that they were all direct
copies from the same original. The Gemblacensis has no
heading at all: the Lipsiensis and Cusanus, as we saw, give a
false ascription‚ Arati Astronomz'con. The Cusanus has oc-
casionally readings which look interpolated; the Gemblacensis
is not unfrequently at fault, and requires to be corrected from
the two other MSS. All three still await adjudication3 sor
though, thanks to M. Paul Thomas, we now possess a perfect
and accurate collation of G, our knowledge of the Lipsiensis
(Iacob’s L) and Cusanus (Iacob’s C) is still incomplete. It
seems, however, probable that at least two distinct copies of
the poem were in circulation at a time considerably anterior to
900 Α. D.: and it would follow that it had been diligently copied
in the revival of classical studies under Charlemagne.

It was towards the close of the xth century that Gerbert‚ the
master spirit of his time, astronomer‚ astrologer‚ mechanician,
magician, statesman, ecclesiastic, lastly (999-1003)‚ as Silvester
II, pope, wrote to the monk Rainard A'ostz‘ quanto studio librorum

p. 117 Havet). The name is given as M. Manilius in the copy
of Gerbert’s letters in the Vallicelliana Library at Rome.

This M. Manlius (or Manilius) de astrologia has generally
been identified with our poet of the five books of Astronomics.
The poem indeed is called Astronomica; but after B. Ι it is
almost wholly occupied with astrology; and the title de Astro-
logia, which would include astronomy, as well as astrology,
would be a better description of it than Astronomica. I should

¹ Victorius is supposed to be the Victorinus who wrote an Expositio in
Rhetorica Ciceronis. Demosthenes Philalethes was a Greek physician of the
Augustan age who wrote on the pulse and three books on affections of the
eyes (Havet Epistt. Gerberti p. 7 note. Gerbert speaks of this Demosthenes
in an earlier letter (Havet p. 7³ to one Abbot Gisalbert thus, De morbis ac
remediis oculorum Demostenes philosophus librum edidit qui inscribitur
Ophthalmicus. In both passages Gerbert seems to mean a Latin work, as
Havet suggests. XVas it a translation P
