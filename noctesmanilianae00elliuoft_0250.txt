2 30 ΟΝ THE NA ME OF MA NILIUS

Manilius, could not be Boetius. For not only is Marcus no part
of Boetius' name, but Gerbert in another passage of his letters
speaks of Boetius, as we might expect, by this single name
and by no other. And though we cannot prove that the de
astrologia Gerbert asks for is a poem, the fact that such a poem
is known to have been extant in the xth and xith centuries, and
the actual ascription of it to M. Mallius (another form of
Manlius) in a MS written indeed in 1470, yet obviously copied
from a very much earlier archetype, seem to more than justisy
the prevailing identification.

In the so-called Dialogus super auctores of Konrad of
Hirschau, a monk of the xiiith century, I have noted one
passage which may possibly refer to our poem, p. 79 ed.
Schepps 1889, elementorum discors concordia quibus nisi astro-
logicis pateret auctoribus? Man, I. 140 sqq. cum per se cuncta
crearinl Frigida nec calidis desint aut humida siccis, Spiritus aul
siccis, sitque lzaec discordia concors, Quae nexus habilis el opus
generabile fingit Atque omnis partus elementa rapacia reddit. The
same combination discordia concors recurs in a corrupt verse at
the end of the poem, V. 728¹). Is there any other auctor astro-
logicus to whom the words of Konrad could with equal aptness
be referred? Yet since the actual combination concordia discors,
not discordia concors, is found in Ow'd M. i. 433, Horace Epp.
i. 12. 29, Lucan i. 98, the above ascription to Manilius must
remain uncertain.

Ι must mention here a fact of some importance, to which
the Dutch scholar lVoltjer was the first to call attention. At
least I can find no reference to it either in Iacob or Bechert.
It is the discovery of a new codex of Manilius in Switzerland
by Poggio during the session of the Council of Constance‚ 1416-
1417 A.n.

The earliest writer who alludes to this is Francesco Barbaro.
In a letter to Poggio dated cx Vcncliis pridie nonas iulias anno
