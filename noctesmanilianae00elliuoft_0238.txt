218 ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANJLJUS

the Phaenomena of Aratus in a Latin form, but had no farther
knowledge of any of the three versions by Cicero, Germanicus,
Avienus, in which the Greek original has been preserved, may
have supposed the five books of hexameters on the stars to
be a Latinized Aratus.

Or, as is more probable, the work of Manilius was contained
in the same volume with one of the Latin versions of Aratus,
and the name was carelessly transferred from the poem to which
it rightly belonged to a work on the same subject, which itself
had been left without a title.

It is not till the xvth century that any MS supplies the
name. It is given variously in these as M. Mallius, Manlius, or
Manilius. The most important of these MSS, the Vossianus
secundus, gives the heading of B. I thus

M Mallii EQOM astronomicon diuo oct qutitrino aug l
proemium lib' p‘r. At the end of B. Ι is written Marcii Mallii
astronomicon liber primus explicit.

At the end of B. II the same MS has M Mallii boeni astro-
nomicon liber iius explicit feliciter: and again B. ΙΙΙ at the end
has M. Mallii astronomicon liber fiius explicit.

The addition of Boeni occurs only here; and the name is not
found either at the beginning or end of the 4th and 5th
books. An Urbino codex in the Vafican, 668 (803), gives the
name in the form M. Ma72272·2·B0ec2·. Another MS, M 31 in the
National Library of Madrid (Bibliothec. Patrum Latinorum
Hispaniensis i. p. 454), of the early xvth century gives the name
at the end of B. II as M. ,Mamm Boclii. It might seem
therefore that Boeni was a corruption of Boetii or Boeci‚ and that
the work was attributed to Boetius, the famous author of the de
Consolatione Philosophiae. Boetius is known to have written on
Astronomy, and has been thought to be the M. Manlius of whose
treatise de Astrologia Gerbert, afterwards Pope Silvester ΙΙ, begs
his friend, the monk Rainard, to procure him a copy together with
Victorius de rhetorica and the Ophllzalmicus of Demosthenes.

Manilius, of which Bentley possessed a collation‚ and of which a
