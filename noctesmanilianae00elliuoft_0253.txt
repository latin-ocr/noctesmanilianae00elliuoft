ΘΝ THE NAME OF MANJLJOE 233

identical with the M. Mallius, M. Mallius Boenus which stand
respectively at the beginning of B. Ι and at the end of B. II
in the Voss.² Which of the two forms, M. Manilius Boetius,
M. Mallius Boenus, more faithfully represents the doubtless
obscured writing of the S. Gallen codex, it would be rash to
pronounce. The Spanish codex has the advantage in priority
of time, the Leyden in simplicity and rude faithfulness to its
original. Antiochus forms no part of the name, and cannot
have been in the S. Gallen codex. But against the genuineness
of the other names (whatever form is the right one) Ι can see
no plausible ground of objection. We may feel assured that
they were copied direct from the codex; and as this, like the
other codices discovered at S. Gallen by Poggio, was no doubt
ancient, the name of the poet of the Astronomica must have
been handed down with the same fidelity which has preserved
the names of Q. Asconius Pedianus, and Gaius Valerius Flaccus
Balbus Setinus.
