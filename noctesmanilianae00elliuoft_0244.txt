224 oN THE NAME OF MANILJUS

follows that we have in this superscription a genuine tradition
handed down from an early period. That period may have
been the age of Firmieus; but it may have been later, the age of
Charlemagne. The parade of titles dwelt on above might not
inaptly suit that epoch of revived but imperfect knowledge; the
substantial fact, the M. AlalliiAslronomicon libri V, would be
a survival from a much earlier time.

It may be well at this point to state the facts, so far as they
are discoverable, as to the knowledge of Manilius’ poem in
classical times.

It is usual to assert that the poem is not mentioned by any
Roman writer. It is certain that Manilius is not included in
the list of poets mentioned by Ovid in the Tristia or that in the
last book of Epistles from Pontus, and that he is ignored by
Quintilian. But it has not been observed that Ovid‚ although
he has nowhere mentioned Manilius by name, seems to allude
to two passages of his Vth book in these verses of the Tristia ΙΙ.
485, 486 Ecce -canit formas alius tactusque pilarum, Hic artem
nandi praecipit, ille trochi. The description of the various ways
of swimming (Man. V. 420-431) is one of Manilius’ happiest
efforts ; the lines about ball-playing (165—171) are less detailed‚
but equally felicitous. Rudolf Merkel believed that the person
whom Ovid attacked in his Ibis was Manilius, founding his view
on the word Poeni which is added to his name in one MS.
Though the uncertainty of this word, which as we have seen is
spelt Boeni‚ Boni, Boelii in other MSS, makes it of little value
as an argument, there are at least two points in which the
writer of the Ibis might seem to allude to Manilius. The first
is the astrological reference Ib. 211—220 ll'alus es infelix, ila
di uoluere, nec ulla Commoda nascenti stella leuz'sue fud. Il'on
