ΟΝ T HE NAME OF MA NJLI US 229

suppose that Gerbert had been informed of the existence of such
a poem and wrote according to the description he had heard.
Other ¹ allusions to astrology are found in the letters of Gerbert
as well as in the Latin poems ascribed to him. He was besides
an indefatigable collector of MSS, and fills his letters with
requests to his friends to procure copies of such authors as he
did not possess ². His correspondents were instructed to procure
him manuscripts from Italy, Germany, and Belgium. It need
not then surprise us to find him asking for a copy of M. Manlius
on Astrology. It is however objected by Havet that this might
be a prose³ treatise; and if so perhaps by Anicius Manlius
Boetius Severinus, who is known to have written on the stars.
Allowing that the work alluded to by Gerbert may have been in
prose, Ι yet consider it certain that its author, M. Manlius or

¹ P. 19 Havet, Librum de astrologia translatum a te michi petenti dirige
et si quid mei uoles in recompensationem indubitate reposce. P. 44 Felix
dies, felix hora, qua licuit nouisse uirum. P. 70 xin the 4 hexameters, no
doubt by Gerbert, on the Archbishop Adalberon )‚ curn te Praestantem
cunctis mortalibus abstulit orbi Quinta dies fundentis aquas cum pondere
rerum. Bothfzmdentis aquas and pondere rerum are Manilian, the former
is used several times=Aquarii‚ the latter occurs IV. 205 Mensurae tribuent
(Chelae, the Balance) usus ac pondera rerum. P. 155 contains a long passage
about the increments of the hours at different times of the year, with a table
of months. In this Gerbert draws from Martianus Capella. P. 131, he had
constructed a sphere, which, however, cannot be finished in a perfect form
with coloured horizon for want of time.

² 1 have noted the following: Suetonius Tranquillus, Q. Aurelius Sym-
machus, Cicero's Verrine Orations and De Republica, the Achilleis of
Statius, and a missing portion of Boetius⁷ Commentary on Aristotle's περὶ
‘Epa-quius. Ρ. 112 Ad praesens autem rescribite tantum quod deest nobis, m
primo uolumine secundae aeditionis Boetii in libro Peri Hermenias, hoc est
ab eo loco unde scriptum est ‘ Non currit uero et non laborat, non uerbum
dieo, cum significat quidem tempus ³ usque ad eum locum ubi dicitur ⁵ Ipsa
quidem secundum se dicta uerba nomina sunt et significant aliquid.'

³ In a letter to Adalberon, Arehbishop of Reims (Havet p. 6), Gerbert
writes Istoriam Iulii Caesaris a Domno Azone abbate Deruensi ad rescri-
bendum nobis adquirite, ut quos penes nos habemus habeatis, et quos post ,
repperimus speretis, id est viii uolumina Boetii de astrologia, praeclarissima
quoque figurarum gometriae (sic) aliaque non minus admiranda. I cannot
believe this Boetius de Astrology'a in viii books to be identical with the
M. Manlius de Astrologia above mentioned. We may be sure that Gerbert
wrote of the works as he had seen them himself or heard them described.
Why should he speak of the same work alternately as viii uolumina Boelz'z'
de Astrologia and then as M. Manlius de Astrologia ? At any rate amongst
the numerous appellations of Boetius the least distinctive is Manlius. And Ι
Gerbert says M. Manlius, a praenomen to which Boetius makes no claim.
