220 ΟΝ THE NAME OF MAAYLJUS

(2) That the name is genuine and descends from anti-
quity.

1. a. The name did not corne from Gerbert’s letters.

In the xivth and xvth centuries the readers of Gerbert's
letters must have been rare. That was a period os reviving
interest in the classical writers of Greece and Rome; if the
letters of Gerbert were read, it was by ecclesiastics. There is not
much in thern of general or literary interest. Copies too were
not likely to be easily procurable. The period of Gerbert
belongs to one of the darkest times of the Middle Age. From
such writings the xivth and xvth centuries turned away with
increasing indifference. Yet, suppose a man like Poggio
coming to the knowledge of the isolated passage in Gerbert’s
letters where M. Manlius de astrologia is mentioned, he would
have taken not only the name of the author, but the title of his
work as he found it. But Gerbert calls the work de Astrologz'a .·
all MSS of the poem call it Astronomz‘con.

b. Nor is it likely that the name came from Pliny.

(ι) It can hardly have been taken from xxxvi. 72 describing
a gilt ball fixed on an obelisk ingenio Facundi Noui mathematici.
For though the words of this passage vary greatly, especially in
the later MSS, and I have myself found facundo Maniam,
facundo M'anlz‘us in two MSS of the Brit. Museum, Harl. 2677
(saec. xv), 15 C. xvii (saec. xiv ineuntis), as before me Isaac
Voss found Mamh'us here in several of his own MSS of the
Historia lVaturalz's, it is difficult to conceive any humanist
venturing to restore conjecturally the lost name of the writer of
the poern on the authority of words so dubiously reported.
Moreover no MS of Pliny adds Illarcz'.

(2) Nor from x. 4 and 5, where a Mamilius¹ or Manilius is
alluded to as a senator of remarkable erudition‚ sels-taught, who
wrote on the Phoenix and connected its duration of life with the

¹ The two oldest MSS in the Brit. Mus„ Arund. 98 and 15 C. xvii, of
xiith and early xivth century respectively, give the name thus: Ar.
manilius twice, but amilio in the index to B. x: 15 C. xvii in x. 4

jieamillliuss then mamilius, in the index manilius. The name was clearly
lami ius.
