ΟΝ THE NAME OF MA NJLIUS 2 25

work ascribed to Ovid which dwells minutely on astrological
details in connexion with any one’s horoscope. The second point
is the recurrence twice of the rare word multzjolz'care. Ib. 206
Ora licet tribuas mulltplz'catcz mihi, 644 filullz'plz'cenlque suo uota
fauore mea. The fondness of Manilius for arithmetic and par-
ticularly multiplicatiori sums must have struck every reader of
the poem comically. See 11. 321 sqq„ III. 260, 279 sqq„
423-617‚ IV. 445-497. Thirdly, the Ibis has at least one
marked feature of Manilius' style, a double que attached to the
two last words of a hexameter, e.g. 177 saxum uoluensque
petensque¹.

Professor J. E. B. Mayor thinks Juvenal may have imitated
Manilius in x. 175 constratum classibus isdem (mare) cf. Manil.
I. 776 Persidos et uictor strarat qui classibus aequor, and in the
declamatory passages on Hannibal, x. 155, 165, cf. Man. IV.
37 Quid refiram Cannas admotaque moenibus arma fl, and Xerxes
cf. Iuv. x. 179 sqq. with Man. IV. 65, 66 Quid Xerxem, maius
el ipso Nazffrogium pelago These indeed are doubtful. Woltjer
however (de Manilio poeta, Groningen, p. 16) cites from a poem
de Luna attributed in the MSS to a certain Claudius (Anth.
Lat. Riese 72 3, Bahrens P. L. M. iii. 163) the following verse—

Luna decus mundi, magni pars maxima caeli,
which is certainly from Manilius V. 12—
Hinc uocat Orion, magni pars maxima caeli.

In the age of Constantine we can point to one writer who
knew and used Manilius, the author of the Latin treatise on
Astrology, Julius Firmicus. Scaliger has collected the passages
in this work which are modelled on Manilius’ poem, and more
recently Bechert has cited the most remarkable of them de
emend. Manil. p. 18. Two of them bear traces of a very
close imitation. Man. V. 61 sqq.

¹ The genuineness of the Ibis can hardly be considered quite established.
The curious agreement of 465, 6 with the torture and death of the Christian
martyr Theodotus looks lii-e interpolation, to say the least. See my paper
in the Journal of Philology for 1885, pp 93— 106, ‘New Suggestions οη the
Ilr‘sss and the ingenious, if hardly probable, view of my friend, Mr. R. W
Raper, w'hieh ls appended as a note to the same article.
