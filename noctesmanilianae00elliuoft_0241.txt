ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANJLJUS 221

revolution of the Magnus Annus. He is not called in either of
these Marcus, and there is no definite reference to astrology.

(3) Nor from xxxv. 199 talemque (i. e. ‘a slave marked for sale
by his chalked feet) Publilium Lochium, mimicae scaenae con-
dz'torem‚ et astrologiae consobrinum eius *Manilium Antiochum,
item grammaticae Staberium Erotem eadem naue aduectos uidere
proauz'. For to say nothing of the chronological difficulty, which
makes it impossible that a contemporary of Publilius Syrus should
have lived on into the time when the poem was dedicated, i. e. the
last years of Augustus, or (as Tristan, Lachmann, and Freier
thought) the beginning of the reign of Tiberius3 it is strange
that the supposed xvth century author of the heading should
omit Antiochzff, which all the MSS of Pliny contain‚ and add
Boenz' (Poenz) which they do not.

It might be urged that the Manlius or Manilius, which is found
in all these three passages of Pliny, was adopted as a collective
name, without anything like a minute investigation of chrono-
logical or other difficulties. But if so, why do the MSS of
Manilius add the praenomen Marcus, which is not found in
any of the three passages of Pliny? This argument becomes
stronger when we remember that after the middle of the ivth
century A.v. c. no Manlius assumed this particular praenomen
(Is. Voss ap. Sherburne Pref. to Transl. of Manilius), a fact
which is now familiar to most Latin scholam, and may have
been so then.

c. The same thing results from an examination of Voss.2
This MS, though dated 1470, is from first to last unmis-
takably free from interpolation. In a great number of passages
it has preserved the true reading where the other MSS, even
those of the xith or xiith century, obscure or corrupt it. This is
more telling from the strange disguises and distortions which
characterize the MS. KVords are wrongly separated, the
last syllable or syllables coalesce with the beginning of the
following word, letters are barbarously interchanged; sometimes

¹ Antiochus is only found in one of the 18 MSS of Manilius enumerated
by Bechert p. 14.
