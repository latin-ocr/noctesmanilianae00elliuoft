222 ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANJLJUS

a half-verse remains as in II. 903 which has fallen out of all the
other MSS. Ι believe no one who, like myself, has examined the
Vossianus² for a considerable time and in comparison with other
codices of Manilius, can fail to acknowledge its unique irn-
portance as an uncorrupted authority for the restitution of the
text of the poem. Now if this codex is thus trustworthy as a
whole, it seems to follow that it is trustworthy, at least so far
as late interpolation goes, in the superscribed headings or tituli
of each book. It is therefore worth while to examine these.
That prefixed to B. Ι runs thus :

M Mallii EQOM astronomicon diuo oct quuirino aug] pro-
emium lib' pr.

At the end of B. Ι ,

Marcii Mallii astronomicon liber primus explicit.
At the end of B. ΙΙ

M Mallii boeni astronomicon liber iius explicit feliciter.
At the end of B. ΙΙΙ

M. Mallii astronomicon liber iiius explicit feliciter.

It is obvious that the heading of B. I was copied, like the
rest of the MS, from an original which was obscure and
imperfect. What is EQOM? whence the addition, only at
the end of Β. ΙΙ, of Boenz'? is Oct quu'zrz'no Octauiano Quirino,
or, as Freier suggests, a mere corruption of Octauiano? The
latter hypothesis is in perfect agreement with the phenomena
of the MS elsewhere, and seems to be at least possible, though
the combination of the three titles Augustus, Diuus, Quirinus
in I. 800, 801 makes it, as an explanation, somewhat unlikely.

Iacob suggested that EQOM was the remains of an original
EQ. ROM. This is certainly the natural view3 and if it was
so, it adds to the improbability of the superscription taking form
in the xvth century, For (1) none of the passages of Pliny
call Manilius, Mamilius, or Manlius a Roman eques: (2) if
they had so called him, it is difficult, if not impossible, to inia-
gine the words EQ. ROM. becoming indistinct or obscure jn
the short interval which elapscd between the introduction (pre-
sumably in the early xvth century) of these words into the
